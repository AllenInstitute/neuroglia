    Traces are sampled relative to the event time. There is no enforced
    constraint that the times of events or sample_times relative to the events
    need to align to trace sample times. Rather, samples are interpolated from
    the values in the traces DataFrame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    traces : pandas DataFrame with 'time' as the index and neuron IDs in columns
        The traces that will be sampled from when the transform method is called
    func : function
        Function that will be applied to trace samples within epochs

    Notes
    -----

    This estimator is stateless (besides constructor parameters), the
    fit method does nothing but is useful when used in a pipeline.
